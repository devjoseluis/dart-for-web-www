If you're here, hopefully you now know Dart's syntax. Syntax is important, but what's really important is how you leverage the language and how productive it allows you to be. So now we'll start the good stuff.

One of my favorite courses on the internet is [Wes Bos's JavaScript 30](). If you aren't familiar, it takes the approach of giving 30 simple, bite-sized lessons that teach core concepts of JavaScript on the web. A lot less can go wrong and there's a lot less set up than the 'lets build a monolithic thing' style guide.

I'm aiming for that style guide.

### Get Setup

First, you need to set up your environment. Down load the course repo here:

[Dart30 lessons]()

In this repo, you'll find 30 lessons, each with 2 sub directories: Start and Finish. Your goal is going to be to get Start to work like finish.

Here we go!
